    excerpt: "Our researcher took part in ExploreAI, a family-friendly exhibition open to the public during European Researchers’ Night. They introduced a tool designed to aid Irish speakers in contributing to Vicipéid (the Irish Wikipedia). This tool generates concise, editable text for new Wikipedia pages without the use of large language models like GPT, employing a rule-based approach that captures the intricacies of the Irish language."
